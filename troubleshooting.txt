== RPI BIRD TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE ==

Component: Kinect

Test: terminal command lsusb

Symptom: no Kinect devices present
Cause: Problem in USB cable

Symptom: only "NUI Motor" is present, no "NUI Camera" or "NUI microphone"
Cause: No 12V power to Kinect, double-check connections (especially floppy connector to PSU)          

Component: Feathers

Test: terminal command i2cdetect -y 1

Symptom: sudden ramp in PSU fan or Pi red LED flickering when connecting new component
Cause: Short in 5V line. CUT POWER IMMEDIATELY and locate the short with multimeter.

Symptom: Controllers do not appear in i2cdetect
Cause: Loose connection in SCL, SDA, or 3.3V VCC lines. When troubleshooting, bear in mind that a break at one controller will cause all "downstream" controllers to disappear.

Symptom: LEDs active, but not servos
Cause: No 5V power. Check connections.

Symptom: LEDs active, but some colors missing or incorrect
Cause: Loose connection or short on LED/servo board.

Symptom: Green LED turns on when 5V is switched on
Cause: Cables plugged into wrong positions, or possibly short from 5V to LED Green (2nd position of both headers) on power board.

Component: Microphone

Test: lsaudio.py

Symptom: Main program throws "no microphone" or bitrate error
Cause: Microphone not initialized or on wrong channel - lsaudio to check channel, this usually also fixes initialization for some reason.

Symptom: Microphone detected but not reacting to sound
Cause: Mircophone is hardware-muted. Press red button (it should be solid red in normal operation)

Component: Neopixels

Test: neopixel-test.py

Symptom: Refresh rate very slow
Cause: Code inefficiency. Ensure that auto-write is disabled, that the array is being written to exactly once per frame, and that you are not calling functions a senseless number of times.
